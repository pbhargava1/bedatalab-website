### Pablo Cardenas

A native of Bogotá, Colombia, Pablo spent his undergrad at Universidad de Los Andes grappling with the frustrations of experimental and field research, and finding refuge in theoretical and computational biology. After majoring in biological sciences with a minor in bioinformatics, he left Bogotá to work in industry and academic research in Arizona, Paris, and Boston, where he learned that experiments fail in labs on every continent and of every budget. Resigned to his fate, he came to MIT as a Biological Engineering PhD student in 2018 to join Jacquin Niles’s lab, known as a quality malaria wet lab more than as a dry lab. Throughout his tenure there, he hopes to change the latter without setting fire to the former.

Besides developing molecular and computational tools for malaria research, Pablo served as TA for 20.420 (Principles of Biomolecular Engineering), is a peer conflict coach with the BE REFS, and spends time playing way more musical instruments than he can ever realistically be good at.

### Itai Levin

&nbsp;

Itai is a PhD student in the biological engineering department. He is currently working jointly with the Voigt Lab and the ColeyResearch Group on computationally designing biosynthetic pathways. Originally from San Francisco, Itai graduated from Cornell University with a degree in chemistry. He enjoys running, baking, and watching YouTube videos about urban planning. He is a proud member of the BE IM dodgeball team (2019 champions).

### Prerna Bhargava

Prerna graduated from Brandeis University with a dual degree in biology and legal studies. She completed her PhD at Harvard University under Dr. Chih-Hao Lee, and her postdoc at MIT in Dr. Jim Collins’ lab. Her interdisciplinary research has encompassed molecular biology, genetics, immunology, microbiology, and cellular biology. During this time, Prerna also mentored dozens of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. She has TA’d and taught several classes, from dance to medical microbiology, and was a Communication Fellow with the Broad Research Communication Lab. Through all these experiences, Prerna has developed a deep interest in supporting higher education and improving the classroom experience to make science more accessible, encourage more students to enter and stay in STEM fields, and support critical thinking beyond the classroom. Outside of work, Prerna loves traveling, dancing, gardening, exploring local restaurants, and creating art.

### Maxine Jonas

Dr. Maxine Jonas is an instructor in the Department of Biological Engineering, and one of its alumnae. After undergraduate studies at École Polytechnique in France, Maxine completed in 2006 her PhD in BE under the mentorship of Prof. Peter So. She then embarked on working in the biotech industry in the Boston area, both in start-up and in large company environments, for seven years prior to returning to MIT campus. Maxine’s interests include biological imaging, biophysics, neurotechnology, computational modeling, drug metabolism, and education. She currently teaches lab-focused courses (20.109, 20.203, 20.309, 20.345), lecture-instructed classes (20.310, 20.430), and seminars (SP.247). Outside of troubleshooting mutagenesis plasmids or realigning students’ microscopes, Maxine loves theater plays, in books or live, daydreaming in museums, and loves water: swimming, sailing, riding her bike in the rain, skiing on the northeastern ha’d-packed or in the spring slush, skydiving through clouds, and drinking bubbly water.
