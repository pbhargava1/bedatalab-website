## The MIT BE Data Lab provides peer coaching on data analysis and coding for life sciences researchers and students at MIT.

&nbsp;

Inspired by the [BE Comm Lab](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/be/)'s mode of operation,
we provide on-demand, discipline-specific, 1-1 coaching to help students and
researchers plan and carry out computational projects.

### We provide support for the following specific languages and frameworks:

- Python (numpy, pandas, sklearn, ...)
- R - (RNAseq data analysis)
- Matlab
- ComSol
- Git (through GitHub)

### We also provide support for the following courses:

- 20.109 - Laboratory Fundamentals in Biological Engineering
- 20.309 - Biological Instrumentation and Measurement
- 20.420 - Fundamentals of Biomolecular Engineering
- 20.440 - Analysis of Biological Networks

Check out our [Q&A](/qanda) for more information on what we do.
